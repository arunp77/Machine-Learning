    "* Covariance provides insight into how two variables are related to one another.\n",

    "* Covariance measures the total variation of two random variables from their expected values. Using covariance, we can only gauge the direction of the relationship (whether the variables tend to move in tandem or show an inverse relationship). However, it does not indicate the strength of the relationship, nor the dependency between the variables.\n",
    "* On the other hand, correlation measures the strength of the relationship between variables. Correlation is the scaled measure of covariance. It is dimensionless. In other words, the correlation coefficient is always a pure value and not measured in any units.\n",

    "    1. Covariance can take on practically any number while a correlation is limited: -1 to +1.\n",
    "    2. Because of its numerical limitations, correlation is more useful for determining how strong the relationship is between the two variables.\n",
    "    3. Correlation does not have units. Covariance always has units.\n",

    "- Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient for the CLT to hold. CLT is useful in finance when analysing a large collection of securities to estimate portfolio distributions and traits for returns, risk, and correlation.\n",
    "- According to the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample of data will be closer to the mean of the overall population in question, as the sample size increases, notwithstanding the actual distribution of the data. In other words, the data is accurate whether the distribution is normal or aberrant.\n",
    "- Key component of CLT is:\n",
    "    * Sampling is successive,\n",
    "    * Sampling is random,\n",
    "    * Samples should be independent,\n",
    "    * Samples should be limited,\n",
    "    * Sample size is increasing.\n",
    "- A Central Limit Theorem word problem will most likely contain the phrase “assume the variable is normally distributed”, or one like it."
