    "## Types of risks analyzed in the financial banking sector\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Credit risk\n",
    "Credit risk refers to the potential for financial losses resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to fulfill their financial obligations. It arises when borrowers or counterparties are unable to repay their loans or meet their contractual obligations. This risk can be mitigated through credit assessments, collateral requirements, diversification of credit exposures, and the use of credit derivatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A bank lending money to individuals or businesses faces credit risk. If a borrower defaults on their loan payments, the bank may suffer financial losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters used to calaculate credit risk:** To calculate credit risk, several parameters are commonly used. These parameters help assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and estimate the likelihood and potential impact of default. Here are some key parameters used in credit risk analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Default (PD):** PD measures the likelihood that a borrower will default on their credit obligations within a specific time frame, usually expressed as a percentage. It is based on historical data, credit ratings, financial indicators, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Historical Method: PD = (Number of Defaults within a specific time period) / (Total Number of Observations within the same time period)\n",
    "  - Credit Rating Transition Matrix Method: PD = (Probability of Transition from Non-Default Rating to Default Rating) * (Probability of Default Rating)\n",
    "  - Merton Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Given Default (LGD):** LGD estimates the potential loss that a lender may incur if a borrower defaults. It represents the portion of the outstanding loan or credit exposure that is unlikely to be recovered in the event of default. LGD is typically expressed as a percentage of the exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Direct Method: LGD = (Total Exposure - Recovered Amount) / Total Exposure\n",
    "  - Workout Method: LGD = (Total Loss - Recovered Amount) / Total Exposure\n",
    "  - Statistical Method: LGD = 1 - Recovery Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exposure at Default (EAD):** EAD refers to the total amount of exposure that a lender has to a borrower at the time of default. It represents the maximum potential loss that can occur if a borrower defaults. EAD includes the outstanding loan balance, unused credit lines, and other forms of exposure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Simple Approach: EAD = Outstanding Loan Balance + Undrawn Credit Lines\n",
    "  - Basel Approach: EAD = Exposure Value x Credit Conversion Factor (CCF)\n",
    "  - Advanced Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Rating:** Credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies provide an indication of a borrower's creditworthiness. Ratings assess the likelihood of default and can help lenders gauge the level of credit risk associated with a borrower. Common rating scales include AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, C, with each category representing different levels of creditworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Ratios and Indicators:** Various financial ratios and indicators are used to assess the financial health and stability of borrowers. These may include \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - debt-to-equity ratio, \n",
    "    - current ratio, \n",
    "    - profitability indicators, \n",
    "    - cash flow analysis, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    and other metrics that provide insights into the borrower's ability to meet their financial obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collateral and Guarantees:** The presence of collateral or guarantees can mitigate credit risk. Collateral refers to assets provided by the borrower that can be used to recover losses in case of default. Guarantees are commitments from third parties to fulfill the borrower's obligations if they default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Industry and Economic Factors:** Credit risk analysis also considers industry-specific factors and macroeconomic conditions that may impact a borrower's ability to repay debts. Factors such as market trends, regulatory changes, and economic indicators are taken into account to evaluate credit risk.\n",

    "### 2. Market risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Market risk models and methodologies are used by financial institutions to assess and manage potential losses arising from changes in market conditions, such as fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. These models and methodologies help quantify and monitor market risk exposures and assist in making informed risk management decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An investment fund holding a portfolio of stocks is exposed to market risk. If the stock prices decline due to market downturns, the fund's value may decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used market risk models and methodologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value at Risk (VaR):** VaR is a widely used measure for estimating potential losses due to market risk. It quantifies the maximum loss within a specified confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%) over a defined time horizon. VaR can be calculated using historical data, parametric models (such as variance-covariance models), or Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Shortfall (ES):** Also known as Conditional VaR, ES estimates the average loss beyond the VaR level. It provides additional information about the tail risk and potential losses beyond the confidence level captured by VaR.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stress Testing:** Stress testing involves subjecting a financial portfolio or institution to extreme scenarios to assess the impact on market risk exposures. Stress tests help evaluate the vulnerability of portfolios to adverse market conditions and assess capital adequacy under severe scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Historical Simulation:** This method uses historical market data to estimate potential losses. It involves constructing a portfolio's profit and loss distribution based on past market movements and calculating the losses at specified confidence levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Monte Carlo simulation generates multiple random scenarios based on modeled assumptions for market variables. By simulating thousands of potential scenarios, it provides a distribution of possible portfolio outcomes and helps estimate potential losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Factor Sensitivity Analysis:** This analysis examines the impact of changes in individual risk factors on the portfolio's value or returns. It helps identify which market variables have the most significant influence on the portfolio's risk and allows for targeted risk management actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Measures for Specific Instruments:** Different market risk models and methodologies are used for specific financial instruments, such as interest rate risk models for fixed income securities, option pricing models for equity options, or commodity price models for commodity derivatives. These models consider the unique characteristics and sensitivities of each instrument to assess market risk exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value Adjustments (XVA):** XVAs are adjustments made to the value of derivatives and other financial instruments to account for counterparty credit risk, funding costs, and other risk factors. XVAs are calculated using models that incorporate market risk factors along with credit risk and funding cost components."

    "\n",
    "The process of risk analysis in the financial banking sector involves several key steps. While the specific approach may vary among institutions, here are the common steps typically followed in conducting risk analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Risk Identification: \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to identify and document the various risks that the bank is exposed to. This includes examining potential risks related to credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, and reputational factors. Risk identification involves reviewing \n",
    "- **Internal Data Analysis:** Analyzing historical data within the institution can help identify patterns, trends, and potential risks. This includes reviewing past incidents, losses, and near-miss events to identify areas where risks have materialized or have the potential to occur in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **External Research and Industry Analysis:** Conducting research and staying updated on industry trends, market conditions, regulatory changes, and emerging risks can provide valuable insights into potential risks that may impact the financial sector. External sources such as industry reports, market studies, regulatory announcements, and news sources can be used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Registers and Checklists:** Using predefined risk registers and checklists can help systematically identify risks across different areas of banking operations. These tools typically cover a wide range of risk categories, including credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, and liquidity risk, prompting risk managers to consider specific risk factors relevant to their institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Workshops and Brainstorming:** Conducting risk workshops and brainstorming sessions involving key stakeholders can provide a platform for collaborative discussions on potential risks. These sessions allow participants to share their expertise, experiences, and insights to identify risks that may not be apparent through other methods. Facilitated discussions can encourage a comprehensive examination of risks from different perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing:** By simulating various scenarios and stress tests, institutions can identify risks that may arise under adverse conditions. This involves modeling different economic, financial, and operational scenarios to evaluate their impact on the institution's financial position, profitability, and risk exposure. Stress testing helps identify vulnerabilities and assess the resilience of the institution to withstand adverse events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regulatory and Compliance Analysis:** Staying updated on regulatory requirements and compliance obligations is essential for identifying risks related to legal and regulatory compliance. Analyzing regulatory changes, enforcement actions, and compliance failures in the industry can provide insights into potential risks and areas where the institution may be exposed to compliance-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Indicators and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):** Developing and monitoring risk indicators and KRIs can help identify early warning signals of potential risks. These indicators are specific metrics or measures that are closely linked to the occurrence or amplification of risks. By establishing thresholds and monitoring deviations, institutions can identify and address risks before they escalate.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Above table can be explained in more details as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assessing Portfolio Risk:** Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the potential risk and volatility of investment portfolios. By simulating thousands or millions of potential market scenarios, it generates a distribution of portfolio returns. This allows risk analysts to calculate risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) at different confidence levels. These metrics provide insights into the potential downside risk and help investors make informed decisions regarding portfolio diversification, risk tolerance, and hedging strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario Analysis:** Monte Carlo simulation enables risk analysts to perform scenario analysis by simulating a range of possible _future scenarios_ and evaluating their impact on financial outcomes. This involves considering multiple factors such as market conditions, interest rates, exchange rates, or macroeconomic variables. By incorporating these variables into the simulation, analysts can assess the potential effects of different scenarios on key performance indicators, cash flows, or profitability measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stress Testing:** Monte Carlo simulation is used in stress testing exercises to evaluate the resilience of financial institutions or portfolios under adverse conditions. It involves simulating extreme scenarios, such as market crashes, economic recessions, or liquidity shocks, to assess the impact on risk exposures, capital adequacy, or liquidity positions. By stress testing using Monte Carlo simulation, risk analysts can identify vulnerabilities, evaluate worst-case scenarios, and design risk mitigation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Monte Carlo simulation helps in evaluating and comparing different risk mitigation strategies. By simulating the effectiveness of various risk management techniques, such as diversification, hedging, or asset allocation adjustments, it enables risk analysts to quantify the potential impact of these strategies on risk reduction. This allows decision-makers to make informed choices and implement risk mitigation measures based on the simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Risk Analysis:** Monte Carlo simulation is employed in credit risk analysis to estimate credit-related metrics such as Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), or Credit Value-at-Risk (CVaR). By simulating potential default scenarios and incorporating factors such as default correlations, recovery rates, or credit rating migrations, it helps assess the credit risk of individual loans or credit portfolios. This information is crucial for credit risk management, loan pricing, and the calculation of regulatory capital requirements.\n",

    "This step involves measuring and quantifying the identified risks in monetary terms or other relevant units of measurement. Here are some common measures for risk in the financial sector:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value-at-Risk (VaR):** VaR is a widely used measure that estimates the potential loss in the value of a portfolio or position over a specified time horizon at a certain level of confidence. It provides an estimate of the maximum loss that an organization may face under normal market conditions. VaR is commonly used to measure market risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Loss (EL):** Expected Loss is a measure that estimates the average loss that an organization is likely to experience from a particular risk. It considers both the probability of occurrence and the potential impact of the risk. Expected Loss is often used to assess credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR):** CVaR, also known as Expected Shortfall (ES), is a measure that provides an estimate of the expected loss beyond the VaR level. It quantifies the potential losses in the tail of the risk distribution, capturing the severity of extreme events. CVaR is useful for assessing risks associated with rare or extreme events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk-adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC):** RAROC is a measure that evaluates the risk-adjusted profitability of an investment or business line. It considers the potential returns generated by the investment relative to the risks taken. RAROC helps in assessing the efficiency of capital allocation and supporting decision-making on resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):** KRIs are specific metrics or indicators used to monitor and measure risks. They act as early warning signals by highlighting deviations from normal risk levels or thresholds. KRIs are tailored to specific risk types and provide ongoing monitoring of risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Ratings:** Credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies are measures of credit risk associated with financial instruments, such as corporate bonds, sovereign debt, or structured products. These ratings assess the creditworthiness and likelihood of default of the issuer, providing an indication of the credit risk involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Given Default (LGD):** LGD is a measure that quantifies the potential loss a lender may face if a borrower defaults on a loan or credit obligation. It represents the portion of the exposure that is unlikely to be recovered in the event of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capital Adequacy Ratios:** Capital adequacy ratios, such as the Basel III regulatory framework's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, measure the financial institution's capital reserves relative to its risk-weighted assets. These ratios help assess the organization's ability to absorb losses and meet regulatory capital requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operational Risk Indicators:** Operational risk indicators measure risks associated with internal processes, systems, and people. They capture metrics such as the frequency of operational incidents, the time taken to resolve issues, or the level of compliance with internal controls. Operational risk indicators help monitor and manage operational risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stress Testing Results:** Stress testing involves subjecting financial institutions' portfolios and balance sheets to extreme scenarios or stress events. The results of stress tests provide insights into the potential impact of adverse events on the organization's financial health and resilience.\n"

    "- **Portfolio Optimization:** Monte Carlo Simulation can be used to optimize investment portfolios by simulating various asset allocation strategies. By generating random samples of asset returns, the simulation can estimate the expected portfolio returns, risk measures such as standard deviation or Value at Risk (VaR), and optimize the portfolio composition to maximize return or minimize risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option Pricing:** Monte Carlo Simulation is widely employed in option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model. By simulating the future stock price movements based on random samples, the simulation can estimate the option's value and evaluate different option trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Management:** Monte Carlo Simulation is valuable in assessing and managing risks in the financial sector. It can be used to simulate market risks, credit risks, operational risks, and other types of risks. By generating random scenarios, the simulation can quantify the potential losses, estimate risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) or Expected Shortfall (ES), and evaluate risk mitigation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Planning:** Monte Carlo Simulation can aid in financial planning and retirement analysis. By incorporating variables like income, expenses, investment returns, and lifespan, the simulation can generate random scenarios of future financial situations. This helps individuals or financial advisors make informed decisions about saving, spending, and investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stress Testing:** Monte Carlo Simulation is utilized for stress testing financial systems and institutions. By simulating extreme scenarios and generating random samples of variables like market shocks or defaults, the simulation can evaluate the resilience and stability of financial systems, identify potential vulnerabilities, and inform regulatory decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Risk Assessment:** Monte Carlo Simulation can be applied to credit risk assessment, especially for loan portfolios and credit derivatives. By simulating default events and loss given default, the simulation can estimate credit risk measures, such as expected loss or probability of default, and evaluate credit portfolio performance under different scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Modeling:** In many real-world scenarios, future outcomes or returns are uncertain and can vary. By generating random samples for the annual returns, we are introducing variability and capturing the uncertainty associated with the investment's performance. Each random sample represents a potential outcome or scenario.\n",
    "\n",

The choice of the distribution depends on the characteristics of the data and the assumptions made. By generating random samples from the distribution, we can simulate a range of potential returns, accounting for both positive and negative outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Simulations:** Monte Carlo Simulation typically involves running multiple simulations to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the possible outcomes. Each simulation consists of a set of random samples representing the annual returns. By running numerous simulations with different random samples, we can explore a wide range of potential scenarios and obtain a statistical distribution of the investment's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis:** After performing the simulations, we can analyze the results to derive meaningful insights and assess the risk associated with the investment. The statistical analysis involves calculating various measures such as mean, standard deviation, percentiles, and confidence intervals. These statistics provide information about the expected value, variability, and potential downside risks of the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, generating random samples for the annual returns allows us to model uncertainty, simulate different scenarios, and analyze the range of possible outcomes. It enables us to make more informed decisions, evaluate risks, and understand the distribution of potential investment performance. The formula used to generate the random samples:\n",

    "The formula generates random samples by randomly selecting values from the normal distribution with the specified mean (`annual_return`) and standard deviation (`volatility`).\n",
